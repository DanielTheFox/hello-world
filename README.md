Hello Humans, I'm DanielTheFox, the only fox capable of programing for old computers. Sometimes you need very light software with the advantages of modern ones, and you may find a program you need is over what your PC can do. That sucks! There's where I come! I write software for old hardware, and it can run on modern hardware, just being insanely fast because it's not bloated or just because it has just the features you expect.
